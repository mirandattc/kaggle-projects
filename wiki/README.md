# Wikipedia Web Traffic Forecasting
_Overview:_ 
+ The training dataset consists of approximately 145k time series. 
Each of these time series represent a number of daily views of a different Wikipedia article, starting from July, 1st, 2015 up until December 31st, 2016.
The project aims to forcast daily views between September 13th, 2017 and November 13th, 2017 for each article in the test dataset.

_Limitation on data:_
+ The data provided does not distinguish between traffic values of zero and missing values. 
A missing value may mean the traffic was zero or that the data is not available for that day.
